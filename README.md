# [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)

Originally the course is taught in using Java as the choice of programming language, but I have implemented examples and solved the problem sets on Kotlin.

## How to run

I am using the Kotlin command line compiler, but you can use whatever. To test my code faster, I have also created a small `.sh` file, `run.sh` which can help you run your code faster, if your setup is similar you can also use it, just pass the name of the file as argument.

Example:
`./run.sh hello`

This will compile and pack everything in jar file and then run it to show you the output.

**That's kinds it. Okay Bye ðŸ‘‹**
